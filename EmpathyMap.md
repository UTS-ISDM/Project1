Relationship Managers
RMâ€™s are the main employees of the call centre and have the role of interacting with customers and potential buyers

Due to their experience, during development of the new system they may be able to provide some guidance on what they think appropriate criteria for changing the call flow rate may be.  

## 1.3. What do they SEE?
As call centre employees they commonly see their jobs being outsourced overseas to areas that can provide cheaper labour so this would be a source of worry for them. With the development of this new system they may see it as an inconvenience as now the call flow rate will be determined on a performance basis rather than random as it was before.
