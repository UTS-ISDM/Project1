## 4.1 Reflect, Assumptions, POV and HMW
Reflection / Assumptions
We have created the following assumptions and stated our reflections for the System call management system
__Payment Method__
From the system we realised that for the customers to pay for their desired holiday packages, the system must be able to support various payment methods such as Card, EFT, Telegraphic Transfer, Paypal and etc. Hence, we require that our system should be able to support such payment features for ease of payment if our customers are not present in the shop itself.

__Set of tasks to perform on the system__
For the system to provide the necessary features we need the development team to be able to create the necessary programs and tools required for the Call Management Centre to succeed in its new calling-system. Such features can include profiling of customers or even sorting customerâ€™s to the most appropriate and similarly described Relationship Managers to ease on the traffic of the calls during Inbound and Outbound Calls.

__Maintenance and Support of Product after Development__
For the system to be successful, the system needs to be developed in a way that it can be easily updated in the future to compensate for any bugs created as a result of produced features required in the system. The developers should be able to communicate between new developers of the written software to be able to easily hand-over the project in case of any switches in the team so that the work may continue smoothly even after development

## 4.2 Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails 8. Document in GitHub all your iteration and models as you progress.
