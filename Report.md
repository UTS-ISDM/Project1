# 1. Problem Definition
## 1.1 Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology). 
The project's primary goals are to create a new information system solution for usage inside a call management centre, that will assist employees with the management of calls and customer profiles, in order to improve efficiency in selling holiday packages. The current  system does not provide the call centre with the ability to match customers to Relationship Managers (RM’s) dynamically based on the RM’s past performances and does not allow for customers to be matched with the most suitable RM available at the time. The current solution is basic with no processes in place to help maximise the effectiveness of the call centres pairings, so this is a key objective of the newly proposed system. The current solution is causing a loss of revenue for the company as customers are less likely to be matched with appropriate RM’s and are then less likely to continue and make a purchase.

The introduction of both RM and customer profiling will be the backbone of improving the call centres efficiency in creating meaningful matches between their employees and clients. The profiling system will create an individual profile for every RM and customer that will later be used to pair RM’s to customers on both inbound and outbound calls. The key components of the customer profiles will be information on demographics and whether they are a repeat customer, while the RM’s profile will determine their skill level and knowledge on selling certain holiday packages. This will help rectify the current disconnect between customers and getting an appropriate RM with the skills and knowledge relating to their intended holiday destination. Fulfilling the objectives of the new profiling system, and customer pairing should provide an ample solution to the companies current problems of inefficiency.

## 1.2 Identify stakeholders.
The call management system consist of 4 main stake holders. Below is a table of each stakeholder and their responiblity/role they contribute to the system.

Stakeholder | Role/ responibility
----------- | --------------------
Relationship Manager (RM) | RM's along with the customers are the main users of the call management system. Their primary role is sell holiday packages to customers. The call managment system will effectively improve the relationship manager's role by matching a RM to a customer based on the RM's profile.
End Customers | End customers are stakeholders who have preivously brought a holiday package/ have their profile already registered in the system. The development of the call management system must play an important role to easily integrate & retain this customer base during the development phase. 
Potential Customers | Potential customers are customers who are within the target market of the product. They are yet to purchase a product but are with likely probability to potentially become a user of the product. The call management system should ensure that the current system does not defer potential customer's from purchasing a holiday package.
Developers | Developers are the creaters of the Call Management System. Their role is to implement & maintance the call management system based on the requirements of each stakeholder.

## 1.3 Stakeholders Empathy Maps
### 1.3.1 Relationship Managers
**WHO are we empathizing with?**

Relationship Managers (RM's), RM’s are the main employees of the call centre and have the role of interacting with customers and potential buyers

**What do they need to DO?**

Due to their experience, during development of the new system they may be able to provide some guidance on what they think appropriate criteria for changing the call flow rate may be.  

**What do they SEE?**

As call centre employees they commonly see their jobs being outsourced overseas to areas that can provide cheaper labour so this would be a source of worry for them. With the development of this new system they may see it as an inconvenience as now the call flow rate will be determined on a performance basis rather than random as it was before. 

**What do they SAY?**

* Relationship managers will inform the customers of the holiday packages including
* Price
* Duration
* Terms and conditions
* Insurance policies

**What do they DO**

Their main job at the moment is to try and make sales of holiday packages. With success being determined by how many packages are sold.

**What do they HEAR**

They would be constantly hearing from colleagues the issues of being a part of a call centre team such as worries of job security and how long they will continue doing their job.

**What do they THINK and FEEL?**

* Pains (what are their fears, frustrations and anxieties)
Lose job due to new system. The system could become biased depending on whose RM profile matches customers the most
Not having enough input to how the system they use works
* Gains (What are their wants, needs, hopes and dreams?)
For the system to improve the number of customers  they get
They need to maintain their employment to continue providing for themselves/family

# 2. Design Thinking

## 2.1 Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective. 
The approach taken for the design thinking process was to split it up into seven areas, empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. By starting to empathize with the (possible and determined) stakeholders the goal of the project is to develop a Calling Management System which will be able to put their service at a much more competitive level to meet their competitors strengths and their customer’s demands in particular. 

Empathizing is very vague and nothing much is known of what we are empathizing about, thus by using an Empathy Map it becomes possible to document and comment on the users of the future system and their feelings such as what they think, feel, see, say, hear or even do about their current system or even the future system to come. Via their emotions it becomes clear on what is needed for the future system in comparison to the current one and can be used to develop User Stories an artefact used to create the base of the future system. 

Through the immersion of the consumers (End Customers) thoughts and the other main users (the relationship managers) the needs of the users can be defined and their point of views (PoV’s) on the topic are developed. By means of these PoV’s we develop How Might We (HMW) statements to provide potential solutions to the users of the future system using logically created and inferred statements.
These HMW statements are indisputably well used in providing brainstorming ideas for the ideation phase. These ideas are also the potential solutions which were carved out from the point of views otherwise the issues or the user’s worries. It is from these ideas that they are firstly selected for their potential and then their feasibility before moving on to the Prototyping Phase.

As emphasized by the agile manifesto values especially “Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation”, it is important to remember that the ideas to be prototyped should be developed in iterations and as such, each prototyped idea must encompass its ability answer any questions raised and to most importantly discern out any issues with the prototype with constant testing. Re-iterative and constant testing will prove to be highly advantageous as live-user participation will provide the most valuable feedback to creating a working software and at the same time helps to mold the system into what is wanted by the stakeholders in particular. Therefore, this ultimately helps to clear up misunderstandings between the developed prototype versus what is actually needed.

## 4.1 Reflect, Assumptions, POV and HMW
### Reflection / Assumptions
We have created the following assumptions and stated our reflections for the System call management system

__Payment Method__

From the system we realised that for the customers to pay for their desired holiday packages, the system must be able to support various payment methods such as Card, EFT, Telegraphic Transfer, Paypal and etc. Hence, we require that our system should be able to support such payment features for ease of payment if our customers are not present in the shop itself.

__Set of tasks to perform on the system__

For the system to provide the necessary features we need the development team to be able to create the necessary programs and tools required for the Call Management Centre to succeed in its new calling-system. Such features can include profiling of customers or even sorting customer’s to the most appropriate and similarly described Relationship Managers to ease on the traffic of the calls during Inbound and Outbound Calls.

__Maintenance and Support of Product after Development__

For the system to be successful, the system needs to be developed in a way that it can be easily updated in the future to compensate for any bugs created as a result of produced features required in the system. The developers should be able to communicate between new developers of the written software to be able to easily hand-over the project in case of any switches in the team so that the work may continue smoothly even after development

__Receive a Target List__

Relationship managers should also be able to view their targeted list so that they can contact customers who are more likely to purchase a holiday package at the right time.

__Profiles are able to be updated__

Relationship managers profiles are initialized during the start of their career at the company. We realised the RMs should be able to update their profile throughout their career in case there is any sudden changes in circumstances (e.g they learn to speak a new language and can be matched with additional customers).

__Busy time is considered when all RM are currently in a call__

We decided that a busy time is determined by when all relationship managers are currently on a call. During a busy time all inbound calls should be redirected to the interactive Voice Response.

### POV
User | Needs to | Insight
---- | -------- | -------
End & Potential Customers | Payment method online | Customers should be able to make payments through EFT or card.
Developer | Set of tasks to perform on the system | Developers should be getting feedback on the usability of the process and possible improvements required.
Developer | Continue to maintain & support the product after development | Developers should continue to fix issues or any bugs that may occur in the future.
Relationship Managers | Receive a Target List | The RMs should be able to use the list to determine the most likely customers to purchase a holiday package in an outbound call
Relationship Managers | Profiles are able to be updated whenever needed | Profiles are initialised at hiring therefore RM’s should be able to update their profile whenever they need to should their personal information or repetoire change
Developers | Busy time is considered when all RM are currently in a call | Busy time is considered when all Relationship Managers are currently in a call with customers
