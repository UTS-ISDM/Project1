# Executive Summary
<p align="justify"> Through the introduction of the newly developed Call Management System, the report aims to analyse, propose and to exhibit its capabilities as an information system built solely to improve user efficiciency and provide clarity. From various evaluations on the existing system, it was deemed that the system at present had multitudes of flaws and spawned unneeded complexities in the process which led to a great loss of revenue for the company. However, with stakeholder analysis the report documents how each of the stakeholders internal or external to the system will interact and bring forth a change based on their words and how will the newly developed features seek to aid these stakeholders for the product at hand. Moreover, the use of SCRUM has greatly benefitted this project as it allowed for a priotised backlog to be produced which led to an even split of workload which eventually led to sprints on a bi-weekly basis to smoothen the development process. Overall, the report will document the workings of the system with an analysis through a system evaluation aimed to hollow out any of advantages or disadvantages faced by the system in the future. </p>

# 1. Problem Definition
## 1.1 Project Objectives
<p align="justify"> The project's primary goals are to create a new information system solution for usage inside a call management centre, that will assist employees with the management of calls and customer profiles, in order to improve efficiency in selling holiday packages. The current  system does not provide the call centre with the ability to match customers to Relationship Managers (RM’s) dynamically based on the RM’s past performances and does not allow for customers to be matched with the most suitable RM available at the time. The current solution is basic with no processes in place to help maximise the effectiveness of the call centres pairings, so this is a key objective of the newly proposed system. The current system in place is causing a loss of revenue for the company as customers are less likely to be matched with appropriate RM’s and are then less likely to continue and make a purchase. </p>

<p align="justify"> The introduction of both RM and customer profiling will be the backbone of improving the call centres efficiency by creating meaningful matches between their employees and clients. The profiling system will create an individual profile for every RM and customer that will later be used to pair RM’s to customers on both inbound and outbound calls. The key components of the customer profiles will be information on demographics and whether they are a repeat customer, while the RM’s profile will determine their skill level and knowledge on selling certain holiday packages. This will help rectify the current disconnect between customers and getting an appropriate RM with the skills and knowledge relating to their intended holiday destination. Fulfilling the objectives of the new profiling system, and customer pairing should provide an ample solution to the companies current problems of inefficiency. </p>

## 1.2 Stakeholder Identification
<p align="justify"> The call management system consists of 4 main stakeholders whereby the table below aims to show who are these stakeholders and what are their responiblities or roles to which they contribute to the current system. </p>

Stakeholder | Role/ Responibility
----------- | --------------------
Relationship Manager (RM) | <p align="justify"> RM's along with the customers are the main users of the call management system. Their primary role is sell holiday packages to customers. The call managment system will effectively improve the relationship manager's role by matching a RM to a customer based on the RM's profile. </p>
End Customers | <p align="justify"> End customers are stakeholders who have preivously brought a holiday package/ have their profile already registered in the system. The development of the call management system must play an important role to easily integrate & retain this customer base during the development phase. </p>
Potential Customers | <p align="justify"> Potential customers are customers who are within the target market of the product. They are yet to purchase a product but are with likely probability to potentially become a user of the product. The call management system should ensure that the current system does not defer potential customer's from purchasing a holiday package. </p>
Developers | <p align="justify"> Developers are the creaters of the Call Management System. Their role is to implement & maintance the call management system based on the requirements of each stakeholder. </p>

## 1.3 Stakeholders Empathy Maps
### 1.3.1 Relationship Managers
**Who are we empathizing with?**

<p align="justify"> Relationship Managers (RM's), RM’s are the main employees of the call centre and have the role of interacting with customers and potential buyers </p>

**What do they need to do?**

<p align="justify"> Due to their experience, during development of the new system they may be able to provide some guidance on what they think appropriate criteria for changing the call flow rate may be. </p>

**What do they see?**

<p align="justify"> As call centre employees they commonly see their jobs being outsourced overseas to areas that can provide cheaper labour so this would be a source of worry for them. With the development of this new system they may see it as an inconvenience as now the call flow rate will be determined on a performance basis rather than random as it was before. </p>

**What do they say?**

* Relationship managers will inform the customers of the holiday packages including
* Price
* Duration
* Terms and conditions
* Insurance policies

**What do they do**

<p align="justify"> Their main job at the moment is to try and make sales of holiday packages. With success being determined by how many packages are sold. </p>

**What do they hear**

<p align="justify"> They would be constantly hearing from colleagues the issues of being a part of a call centre team such as worries of job security and how long they will continue doing their job. </p>

**What do they think and feel?**

Pains:
* <p align="justify"> Lose current job due to a new outperforming system. The system could become biased depending on whose RM profile matches customers the most. </p>
* Not having enough input to how the system they use works.

Gains:
* For the system to improve the number of customers they are able to win favour of
* They need to maintain their employment to continue providing for themselves or their family.

### 1.3.2 End Customers
**Who are we empathizing with?**

<p align="justify"> The End customers are the customers who currently exist in the system and are the main recipient of the current Call System in-use. </p>

**What do they need to do?**

<p align="justify"> End customers will need to set up their account, user profile, whilst having to continuously let the system know if there are any changes in personal details. End customer will also be required to dial a number reaching the CMC which will automatically route them to a branch. </p>

**What do they see?**

<p align="justify"> End customers are expected to receive calls from the system that will connect them to the relationship manager. They are more likely to take priority as customers with a highest score are served first. </p>

**What do they say?**

<p align="justify"> Potential customers may ask for a quote on holiday packages or discuss what package the package entails. Things they may ask - How long is the holiday? Cost of holiday? Insurance policies? They will also let the relationship manage know if they are interested in purchasing a product. </p>

**What do they do?**

<p align="justify"> End customer’s should listen to what the product package offers and potentially state whether they are or not interested in purchasing the holiday package. If they are interested they will be required to provide purchasing details. If they are not interested they can tell the relationship manager and end the conversation or call. </p>

**What do they hear**

* <p align="justify"> During a call with end customers they will hear the relationship manager speak about in depth details on the holiday package. </p> 
* <p align="justify"> Externally , they may hear from friends and family the annoyances of increased telemarketing calls and scams </p>

**What do they think and feel?**

Pains:	
* Annoyance of telemarketers calling them.	
* Holiday package is not suitable for them - waste of time for customers	

Gains 
* They may be offered a package they are interested in purchasing.
* <p align="justify"> Fulfil a dream of purchasing the package of their choice and going on a holiday to the destination they wish to go to. </p>

### 1.3.3 Potential Customers

**Who are we empathizing with?**

<p align="justify"> A potential customer is one who is not currently using the system but it is highly likely they will use it, as relationship managers (RM’s) call them and try to sign them up for different holiday packages. </p>

**What do they need to do?**

<p align="justify"> Potential customers will be required to create a customer profile/account so that they can utilise the information system service. This allows the system to easily match the customers to the relationship manager based on their needs & skills. </p>

**What do they see?**

<p align="justify"> Potential customers may see the RM’s as an inconvenience if they are not expecting them to reach out and call them. The potential customers probably see many phone call made to them from other telemarketing agencies that may be outsourced overseas with operators who are not highly skilled, this causes them to have a disinterest in all marketing calls. </p>

**What do they say?**

<p align="justify"> Some potential customers are receptive and become customers who purchase holiday packages and are grateful for the work of the RM’s, while other potential customers will be annoyed at being contacted and will say to not make contact with them again. </p>

**What do they do?**

Potential customers cover a wide number of people from all walks of life and can be

**What do they hear**

* <p align="justify"> During a call with end customers they will hear the relationship manager speak about in depth details on the holiday package. </p>
* <p align="justify"> Externally, they may hear from friends and family the annoyances of increased telemarketing calls and scams </p>

**What do they think and feel?**

Pains
* <p align="justify"> The people who are conversing with them are not trustworthy or are dangerous (scammers). </p>
* <p align="justify"> That by purchasing for a package on their phone they have been phished and then scammed because of their lack of knowledge.	</p>

Gains: 
* <p align="justify"> They will ultimately have a desire to go on holiday at some point and would benefit from being sold a holiday package. </p>

### 1.3.4 Developers

**Who are we empathizing with?**

<p align="justify"> Developers are the people responsible for creating the new system for the travel company. They have been contracted by the company to improve the call management centre and play the crucial role of making the project successful. </p>

**What do they need to do?**

<p align="justify"> They will need to elicit all the necessary requirements from current users of the system and work on implementing solutions that reflect the customers needs. </p>

**What do they see?**

<p align="justify"> They see a changing technology landscape where emphasis by younger generations is no longer placed on communication over telephone. </p>

**What do they say?**

<p align="justify"> Developers should inform the company what functionalities are possible based on the budget of the project. If a requirement cannot be met, they should let the company know why and how they may resolve the issue. </p>

**What do they do?**

* <p align="justify"> Develop the software of the calling system to match the requirements sent out to them, from the company. </p>

* <p align="justify"> They will also be required to maintain the software to ensure the functionalities are up to date. </p>

**What do they hear?**

<p align="justify"> They would have heard the company’s requirements of the information system. </p>

**What do they think and feel?**

Pains
* <p align="justify"> May be worried that their final solution could put some people out of a job </p> 
* <p align="justify"> Want to provide a good final solution so the customer is happy and may use their companies services again. </p>

Gains
* <p align="justify"> Worry that they are not able to provide a quality final solution they may gain a negative reputation in the industry. </p>
* <p align="justify"> Improve the customers calling experience and have more successful sales made. </p>

# 2. Design Thinking

## 2.1 Design Thinking
<p align="justify"> The approach taken for the design thinking process was to split it up into the usual seven areas of design thinking namely: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. By starting to empathize with the (possible and determined) stakeholders the goal of the project is to develop a Calling Management System which will be able to put their service at a much more competitive level to meet their competitors strengths and their customer’s demands in particular. </p>

<p align="justify"> Empathizing is very vague and nothing much is known of what we are empathizing about, thus by using an Empathy Map it becomes possible to document and comment on the users of the future system and their feelings such as what they think, feel, see, say, hear or even do about their current system or even the future system to come. Via their emotions it becomes clear on what is needed for the future system in comparison to the current one and can be used to develop User Stories an artefact used to create the base of the future system. </p>

<p align="justify"> Through the immersion of the consumers (End Customers) thoughts and the other main users (the relationship managers) the needs of the users can be defined and their point of views (PoV’s) on the topic are developed. By means of these PoV’s we develop How Might We (HMW) statements to provide potential solutions to the users of the future system using logically created and inferred statements. These HMW statements are indisputably well used in providing brainstorming ideas for the ideation phase. These ideas are also the potential solutions which were carved out from the point of views otherwise the issues or the user’s worries. It is from these ideas that they are firstly selected for their potential and then their feasibility before moving on to the Prototyping Phase. </p>

<p align="justify"> As emphasized by the agile manifesto values especially “Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation”, it is important to remember that the ideas to be prototyped should be developed in iterations and as such, each prototyped idea must encompass its ability answer any questions raised and to most importantly discern out any issues with the prototype with constant testing. Re-iterative and constant testing will prove to be highly advantageous as live-user participation will provide the most valuable feedback to creating a working software and at the same time helps to mold the system into what is wanted by the stakeholders in particular. Therefore, this ultimately helps to clear up misunderstandings between the developed prototype versus what is actually needed. </p>

## 2.2 Scrum Utilization

<p align="justify"> Scrum comes as a subset of agile development methodology where the project has a framework that ensures the completion within the deadline that assigned for the project. Scrum shares several principles with agile development methodology such as continuous improvements and collaboration on self-organised teams’ level which assist in producing a high-quality product with rapid delivery time. Aside from the similarities, scrum stands out as a preferable system development process benefiting from teamwork models where it could increase the productivity, flexibility and creativity throughout the process. </p>

<p align="justify"> Iteration is a crucial part of Scrum development where improvement can be made easily without affecting other parts of the project. By having small iteration, the feedback collected from product owner in any stage during the development process could be implemented without having a significant financial impact as well as different request for additional features or fixing existing bugs within the project. </p>

<p align="justify"> For the project to develop the new Call Management System, scrum in particular was chosen as the preferred methodology to manage the tasks assigned while keeping in mind of the due date of the project. In order to stay in contact with all members developing the system and product owner, a repository Using the online software Github has been created. Github would allow the product owner to monitor the work on the project throughout the entire process and add any recommendations at all time or highlights any changes that are required while the project is in progress. Developers would benefit from using Github as well as customers, Github allows developers to list all their tasks with the ability to sort these tasks depending on the priority of the task for each stage. Github would be an essential part of the work in cases where physical meetings are limited. As scrum requires 15 minutes daily meeting to discuss the progress made for all members of the development team. </p>

<p align="justify"> Throughout the duration of the project, the members of the team as we have agreed to use SCRUM will document and develop the system over multiple iterations where possible, for this the group will meet once every week to have an online team retrospective meeting on what has been done over the previous week and to bring to light on what else must be done for the coming weeks. Also important to this will be continous commits with well worded messages so that each member will be able to keep track on what has been done for each commit cycle. Whenever an issue arises the member must bring up the issue either through GitHub's issue feature or through the team chat for others to help review and work on the issue and to resolve it as soon as possible. </p>

# 4. System Evaluation

## 4.1 Reflections and Assumptions
<p align="justify"> The statements below encompass the assumptions and reflections made for the developed Call Management System especially on certain tasks and areas. </p>

__Payment Method__

<p align="justify"> From the system we realised that for the customers to pay for their desired holiday packages, the system must be able to support various payment methods such as Card, EFT, Telegraphic Transfer, Paypal and etc. Hence, we require that our system should be able to support such payment features for ease of payment if our customers are not present in the shop itself. <p>

__Set of tasks to perform on the System__

<p align="justify"> For the system to provide the necessary features we need the development team to be able to create the necessary programs and tools required for the Call Management Centre to succeed in its new calling-system. Such features can include profiling of customers or even sorting customer’s to the most appropriate and similarly described Relationship Managers to ease on the traffic of the calls during Inbound and Outbound Calls. </p>

__Maintenance and Support of Product after Development__

<p align="justify"> For the system to be successful, the system needs to be developed in a way that it can be easily updated in the future to compensate for any bugs created as a result of produced features required in the system. The developers should be able to communicate between new developers of the written software to be able to easily hand-over the project in case of any switches in the team so that the work may continue smoothly even after development </p>

__Receive a Target List__

<p align="justify"> Relationship managers should also be able to view their targeted list so that they can contact customers who are more likely to purchase a holiday package at the right time. </p>

__Update Profiles__

<p align="justify"> Relationship managers profiles are initialized during the start of their career at the company. We realised the RMs should be able to update their profile throughout their career in case there is any sudden changes in circumstances (e.g they learn to speak a new language and can be matched with additional customers). </p>

__Peak Hours are Considered (Busy Time)__

<p align="justify"> We decided that a busy time is determined by when all relationship managers are currently on a call. During a busy time all inbound calls should be redirected to the interactive Voice Response. </p>

## 4.2 Point of View Statements
User | Needs to | Insight
---- | -------- | -------
End & Potential Customers | Payment method online | Customers should be able to make payments through EFT or card.
Developer | Set of tasks to perform on the system | Developers should be getting feedback on the usability of the process and possible improvements required.
Developer | Continue to maintain & support the product after development | Developers should continue to fix issues or any bugs that may occur in the future.
Relationship Managers | Receive a Target List | The RMs should be able to use the list to determine the most likely customers to purchase a holiday package in an outbound call
Relationship Managers | Profiles are able to be updated whenever needed | Profiles are initialised at hiring therefore RM’s should be able to update their profile whenever they need to should their personal information or repetoire change
Developers | Busy time is considered when all RM are currently in a call | Busy time is considered when all Relationship Managers are currently in a call with customers

## 4.3 How Might We Statements
HMW | Potential Solutions 
------- | -------------------------

## 4.4 Competitive Advantage of the System 

<p align="justify"> The development of the new call management system will most definitely prove to effectively increase interactive experience between both the customers and the relationship managers by matching the profiles of the two with their similarity and preferences so that the relationship managers are able to easily win the favour of the customers through their own personal experiences or anecdotes. The CMC aims to gain a competitive advantage over various other holiday call companies by using this matching system through user profiling to increase the efficiency and likelihood of a customer purchasing a holiday package. This result allows (mainly) potential customers to speak to their matched relationship managers whom have a higher level of proficiency in the same language to cater to the wider audience and also similarly able to suggest products based on the RM’s product knowledge and experience. The CMC's new system also helps to accomodate customers who call in during a peak call time by putting them on a wait list such that in this way  the customers will be able to act based off their own decision by knowing the duration to wait for and can decide if they would like to hang up or wait the given amount of time until a Relationship Manager (preferably if they are matching) is available. The CMC also stores information on past customers as this will help the company develop a prolonged relationship with loyal customers as RM’s are more likely to contact customers who receive a higher rating score by the CMC system and prioritizing them when making targeted outbound calls. </p>

<p align="justify"> The use of the newly developed system will also lower the cost of managing the human resources needed which will significantly decrease, thus allowing their resources to be allocated to the relationship managers more efficiently. This means the company is able to reduce the amount of redirected calls and wasted time which occurs between the RM's and Customers due to mismatches that are caused by language barriers or lack of specialized product knowledge for a specific customers preference. However, due to the upgrade in user profiling and matching of the customers & RM, this will statistically, if the RMs are able to resolve package offerings at a faster rate, they are also able to make more calls during their shift thus increasing the revenue for the company much more efficiently with less loses. This is increasingly true in the current sitaution where more often than not, people will have similar ideas to gain a competitive edge in the market, and thus to break the barrier set by any limitations would be to develop a system which can promote as much customer collaboration as possible. Increasing the customer collaboration greatly helps to build a more proportionate system to the likings of the end users or potential customers and most importantly the more efficient the system, the lowe the waiting time which again leads to a greater satisfaction from the users whether it be the customers or the relationship managers. Moreover, with the addition of more automated processes in the business, unnecessary workload is removed which can be redirected to areas in need of more attention thus providing better care for the system which inevitably leads to a more well-balanced design and therefore would result in greater business profits in the long term.</p>

## 4.5 Possible Failure of the Developed System

<p align="justify"> The system is likely to fail if the stakeholders do not contribute their part to the system. The CMC is heavily reliant on it’s user matching software and therefore in order to efficiently and properly allocate their relationship managers they are required to input their personal and professional details correctly to reduce incompetency and miscommunication of information. If any circumstances were to change for any relationship manager, they must swiftly update it through the system as well such that the system can immediately provide the necessary updates to the database to prevent matching errors between the customers and the relationship managers. Thus, some important information is required for efficient matching and that includes the following: </p>

* Proficiency in Languages
* Product Knowledge - Country, Provenance, Tradition, Culture, Location etc.
* Professional Experience 
* Age

<p align="justify"> Secondly, before making an outbound call, a relationship manager must firstly review scores given to customers. The system will automatically generate and provide a target list in the required format and it is the responsibility of the relationship manager to read through the script and target list carefully as a guideline for how to interact with their targeted customers. Failure to do so causes various issues as the relationship manager may be viewed as incompetent or inconsiderate of what they are searching for. This would most definitely cascade into a larger issue and may leave negative remarks or even low ratings on any review sites about the quality of the management and the system in place, which is the reason why the system was developed for in the first place, to reduce as much human error as possible and to act as an auxillary in the equation. </p>

<p align="justify"> Thirdly, developers must continue to maintain and update the developed Call Management System as much as possible and keep supporting its further development. While it is undeniable that the system has been fully completed and implemented, additional features to brace the system will almost certaintly be required in the future. Relationship Managers and Customers alike would also encounter with issues or bugs during the usage of the product and so the developers are responsible for resolving these issues and preferably within a reasonable time period. However, bugs are usually hard to encounter unless certain conditions are met or are hiding blatantly in plain sight which in most cases those would have already been fixed early on. Which is why it is equally as important for the users alike to report these bugs as soon as possible and to notify any member of staff to improve the functionality of the system. </p>
