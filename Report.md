## 3.1 Document your proposed work products and models.
The call management system consist of 4 main stake holders. Below is a table of each stakeholder and their responiblity/role they contribute to the system.

Stakeholder | Role/ responibility
----------- | --------------------
Relationship Manager (RM) | RM's along with the customers are the main users of the call management system. Their primary role is sell holiday packages to customers. The call managment system will effectively improve the relationship manager's role by matching a RM to a customer based on the RM's profile.
End Customers | End customers are stakeholders who have preivously brought a holiday package/ have their profile already registered in the system. The development of the call management system must play an important role to easily integrate & retain this customer base during the development phase. 
Potential Customers | Potential customers are customers who are within the target market of the product. They are yet to purchase a product but are with likely probability to potentially become a user of the product. The call management system should ensure that the current system does not defer potential customer's from purchasing a holiday package.
Developers | Developers are the creaters of the Call Management System. Their role is to implement & maintance the call management system based on the requirements of each stakeholder.
# 4. Competitive advantage & assumptions

## 4.1 Reflect, Assumptions, POV and HMW
### Reflection / Assumptions
We have created the following assumptions and stated our reflections for the System call management system

__Payment Method__

From the system we realised that for the customers to pay for their desired holiday packages, the system must be able to support various payment methods such as Card, EFT, Telegraphic Transfer, Paypal and etc. Hence, we require that our system should be able to support such payment features for ease of payment if our customers are not present in the shop itself.

__Set of tasks to perform on the system__

For the system to provide the necessary features we need the development team to be able to create the necessary programs and tools required for the Call Management Centre to succeed in its new calling-system. Such features can include profiling of customers or even sorting customer’s to the most appropriate and similarly described Relationship Managers to ease on the traffic of the calls during Inbound and Outbound Calls.

__Maintenance and Support of Product after Development__

For the system to be successful, the system needs to be developed in a way that it can be easily updated in the future to compensate for any bugs created as a result of produced features required in the system. The developers should be able to communicate between new developers of the written software to be able to easily hand-over the project in case of any switches in the team so that the work may continue smoothly even after development

__Receive a Target List__

Relationship managers should also be able to view their targeted list so that they can contact customers who are more likely to purchase a holiday package at the right time.

__Profiles are able to be updated__

Relationship managers profiles are initialized during the start of their career at the company. We realised the RMs should be able to update their profile throughout their career in case there is any sudden changes in circumstances (e.g they learn to speak a new language and can be matched with additional customers).

__Busy time is considered when all RM are currently in a call__

We decided that a busy time is determined by when all relationship managers are currently on a call. During a busy time all inbound calls should be redirected to the interactive Voice Response.

### POV
User | Needs to | Insight
---- | -------- | -------
End & Potential Customers | Payment method online | Customers should be able to make payments through EFT or card.
Developer | Set of tasks to perform on the system | Developers should be getting feedback on the usability of the process and possible improvements required.
Developer | Continue to maintain & support the product after development | Developers should continue to fix issues or any bugs that may occur in the future.
Relationship Managers | Receive a Target List | The RMs should be able to use the list to determine the most likely customers to purchase a holiday package in an outbound call
Relationship Managers | Profiles are able to be updated whenever needed | Profiles are initialised at hiring therefore RM’s should be able to update their profile whenever they need to should their personal information or repetoire change
Developers | Busy time is considered when all RM are currently in a call | Busy time is considered when all Relationship Managers are currently in a call with customers

### HMW Statements
HMW | Potential Solutions 
------- | -------------------------
HMW improve the payment system for customers? | <ul><li>The RM or System is able to provide the user with an immediate link to a payment page with their desired package to be paid for</li><li>The system is able to handle the users input actions and follow through with the appropriate payment methods for the user</li></ul>|
HMW provide the feedback to the developers in a way they are able to understand? | <ul><li>A simple bullet point list with simple language used to convey any issues found in the system</li><li>A mind-map can be used to list out all the current issues by linking them with a specific area or feature in the system.</li><li>The relationship managers should actively work with the developers by constantly providing feedback so that the developers may cater with the needs of the system properly</li></ul>
HMW discover the bugs to be found in the system? | <ul><li>The developers should try and actively test the features of the system and create a simple documentation to record any issues found</li><li>The developers should try and keep the code as clean as possible to prevent as many errors so that it does not waste unnecessary amounts of time</li></ul>
HMW allow our developers to fix the bugs in time for release dates? | <ul><li> The developers should try and actively test the features of the system and create a simple documentation to record any issues found. </li><li> The developers should try and keep the code as clean as possible to prevent as many errors so that it does not waste unnecessary amounts of time </li></ul>
HMW enable the relationship manager to view the current target list? | <ul><li> Developers have enabled a way for relationship managers to view a targeted list. </li><li> Relationship managers are able to view the list by a button created by developers  </li></ul>
HMW improve the current relationship management profile to allow for customisation | <ul><li> Relationship managers are able to access their profile. </li><li> Relationship managers are able to make edits at any time as long as they have access to the application. </li></li><li> Edit may include languages proficiencies, experience and product knowledge. </li></ul>
HMW develop a way for the call management system to determine busy times | <ul><li> Customers will redirect as soon as all the phone lines in the office are full. </li><li> Phone lines are disconnected if there are no employees working during that time.  </li></ul>
